          - Rotational Lock: Haz is testing functionality with LED re-integration
          - Magnetometer: Tilly and Luis are working on obtaining an array of solutions for Exercise 2, so that the magnetometer exercise can be repeated over multiple angles.
          - Capacitive Touch: Sam is reworking capactive touch unit to make it more immersive.
          - Communicating to Mission Control: Task completed.
          
          
**13:00**   

          - Tilly and Haz get multiple solutions for Magnetometer activity working
          
**15:00**   

          - Sam has modularised his code for both Capacitive Touch and communicating to Mission Control exercises.
          
          
**16:00**   

          - Luis and Matlyda have each modularised their code for their respective halves of the Magnetomoeter exercise
