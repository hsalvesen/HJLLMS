## Minutes

        
**09:00**  
          
          Group arrives.
          
**09:50**  
          
          Jesse and Khit really liked the safe challenge with demonstration. Wiring needs some tampering so it does not come loose during the assessment and the tolerance of the angle also needs to be adjust
          so that the lock crack challenge is more intuitive.

**10:00**   

          - Rotational Lock -> Harry and Joel setting up practical components of the design and understanding what they may need to purchase to create a working box and other wires that are necessary for functionality
          - Sundial -> Tilly and Luis gain assistance form Jesse and Khit to finalise code function as erros are frequent.
          - Capacitive Touch -> Sam and Lachlan used capacitors from JayCar and a board design inspired by Stewart to enbale a capacitive touch function. Now they just need to come up
          with a challenge design so that the function has an associated challenge for the instructors to complete during the assessment.
          - Knock Test -> Knock test still working and a final idea for the module required for completement during the assessment.
**10:30**   

          Sam returns after JayCar trip and capacitive touch wave generator visualises curve that will be able to register touches during test.
          
**11:30**   

          All code pushed to GitHub.

## Actionables

**Haz + Joel**  
          
          Goals for this week: Finish documentation for submission next week and design builds for both the knock test and capacitive touch as they are the modules that are nearest completion.
          
**Sam + Lachland**  
          
          Goals for this week: Try to finish capacitive touch by the end of next weeks lab.
          
**Matylda + Luis**  
          
          Goals for this week: Continue working on sun dial code and identify what needs to be obtained for the functionality of the test.
