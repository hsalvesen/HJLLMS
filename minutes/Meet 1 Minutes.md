          We have a group of six; we should commit to three ideas that we will do well.

          The ideas that are deciding between are: 
          - Servo position to crack a rotational lock | Haz + Joel
          - Capacitive touch | Sam + Lachlan
          - Sundial idea| Matylda + Luis
          
**10:30**   

          Ideas are run past Jesse, who stands there, shakes his head, spits on us.
          (Figuratively).

## Actionables

**Haz + Joel**  
          
          Goals for this week: Can we move a servo and read from a potentiometer
          
**Sam + Lachland**  
          
          Goals for this week: Can we interface with capacitive touch?
          
**Matylda + Luis**  
          
          Goals for this week: Can we interface with LDRs and the magnetometer
          1.      Collect necessary hardware requirements: A tonne of LDRs, Cardboard for structure 
          2.      Figure out how to take LDR data into code
          3.      Test an LDR
          4.      Test two (one on, one off)
          5.      Figure out how magnetometer works
          6.      Figure out how to calibrate magnetometer
          7.      Figure out how to display position of magnetometer on LED display
          8.      Build casing for sundial
